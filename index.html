         <p>Kevin is our little instagram star, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/apugnamedkevin/">@apugnamedkevin</a>. He was our first dog together, we got him as an 8 year old puppy. He loves car rides more than about anything in the world, except maybe naps.</p>

          <img src="images/Phyllis.jpg" alt="cute girl pug" style="width:300px;height:300px;"/>
          <p>We just adopted Phyllis earlier this summer. She is a sweetheart who loves to please and snuggle. She is either going 100 miles an hour, or 0.</p>

          <p>Milo was my cat before Claire and I got together. I adopted him from the Lawrence Human Society, I got the fattest cat they had. He is a big teddy bar who loves eating grass.</p>

          <p>Ferris was Claire's cat from before we met. He is an adventurer/wild man but has recently been turning into a fat and happy house cat just like his bro Milo.</p>
